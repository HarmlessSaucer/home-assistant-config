# Wireless Light Switches
# I have some wireless Sonoff RF light switches.
# These dont actually connect to mains voltage, instead they are battery powered
# and just send a simple RF signal to my Sonoff RF Bridge, which then sends an 
# MQTT message to Home-Assistant.

# Switch 1 - Livingroom
alias: Switch 1 - Bottom Button
