# Lullaby
#
# This is an old bluetooth speaker I bought a long time ago for about Â£10
# It was just to have in the kitchen and when working round the house.
# It wasnt great, and when it's battery died, I kept it for parts.
# 
# Since then, I have taken out the board and battery from inside, and installed
# a Raspberry Pi Zero W and Adafruit mono audio amplifier, and installed 
# Volumio on the Pi.
# 
# The idea behind this is I can load it with kids songs (at the moment lullabys
# and white noise!) for our daughter Isabella, to help her sleep.  We keep it 
# near her bed, and can control it wirelessly using our phones or tablets.
