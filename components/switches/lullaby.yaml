# Lullaby
#
# This is an old bluetooth speaker I bought a long time ago for about Â£10
# It was just to have in the kitchen and when working round the house.
# It wasnt great, and when it's battery died, I kept it for parts.
# 
# Since then, I have taken out the board and battery from inside, and installed
# a Raspberry Pi Zero W and Adafruit mono audio amplifier, and installed 
# Volumio on the Pi.
# 
# The idea behind this is I can load it with kids songs (at the moment lullabys
# and white noise!) for our daughter Isabella, to help her sleep.  We keep it 
# near her bed, and can control it wirelessly using our phones or tablets.
#
# I have loaded this player with specific MP3s and created a playlist in the 
# interface. I then created a command_line switch to start this playlist when
# the switch is activated, and pause it when it is deactivated.  The switch will
# check the status of the player and reflect this in the switch status.
# This is all using the Volumio REST API.  
#
# You can find the media player in:
# ../media_players/lullaby.yaml
