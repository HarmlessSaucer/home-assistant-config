# Hallway
# Front Door Binary Sensor
# 
# 433MHz Hall-Effect Sensor connected to SonoffRF Bridge.
# Communicating with Home-Assistant via MQTT.
# Two codes:
#   Opened:   2D860A
#   Closed:   2D860A
#
# I beleive this sensor also sends a code for battery-low, 
# but I haven't been able to test this yet!
